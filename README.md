## Examples

More examples are coming, but for now there's a basic Json printer in `test/JsonExample.mo` to
give you an idea.
You can run it with `make -C test json`.

## How to develop

- Write your library code in `*.mo` source files in the `src/` directory.
- Run `make check` to make sure your changes compile (or use the
  VSCode extension to get quicker feedback)
- Add tests to the source files in the `test/` directory, and run them
  with `make test`. The project template is set up to include
  motoko-matchers.
- Generate API documentation locally by running `make docs` and then
  open the resulting `docs/index.html` in your browser
